# 2-D-Monte-Carlo-simulation-of-a-magnetic-material
A 2-D Monte Carlo simulation of a magnetic material to verify a known analytical result using numerical simulations.

## The code is separated into 3 tasks:
### Task 1
Calculating the values for average energy per spin (Espin), average magnetisation per spin (Mue) and specific heat of the system (cv)
and setting up the function to run the Monte-Carlo
### Task 2
Plotting Espin, mue and cv for temperature from 1 to 5

### Task 3
A repeat of task 2 but with different lattice sizes
